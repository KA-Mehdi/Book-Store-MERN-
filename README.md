# Book-Store-MERN 
is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project built using the MERN stack. It allows users to manage a collection of books by adding, viewing, editing, and deleting them.

# Technologies Used
Using React (Vite) with Tailwind CSS for styling in this project helped me gain valuable skills in frontend development.
For the backend, I used Node.js with Express.js for the server side, also relying on tools like Nodemon for automatic server restarts. I created a database using MongoDB, managed by Mongoose, and gained experience in communicating with APIs using the Axios library.


## This project allows users to add, edit, view, and delete books, demonstrating the core CRUD operations in a full-stack web application.
